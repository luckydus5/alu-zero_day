Welcome to my **alu-zero_day** project! ðŸš€

This project is part of my learning journey in **programming and Git/GitHub workflow**. Hereâ€™s what I have included so far:

## Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ best # Bash script that prints "Best School"
â””â”€â”€ school # Bash script that prints "School"

## What Iâ€™m Learning

- How to **create directories and files** in a project
- How to **write basic Bash scripts**
- How to **write C programs** and structure code in folders
- How to **write JavaScript files** and organize them
- How to **use Git commands**:
  - `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`
  - Branching: `git branch`, `git checkout -b`, `git merge`
- How to **collaborate using GitHub**
- How to **update files on GitHub directly** (this README!)

## Notes

- Bash scripts in this project are executable.
- C and JS files are currently empty but ready for coding exercises.
- This repository is a practice ground for coding and version control.
